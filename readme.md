📊 Dataset Visualization
Choose from academic graph datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed

View:

Node and edge counts

Node feature dimensions

Class distribution

Sample feature vectors

Visualize a subgraph (first 20 nodes) of the citation network

🌐 Predicted Class Visualization
After training, view a graph with nodes colored by their predicted class

Helps understand how the model interprets the citation graph structure


🔎 Node Search & Neighborhood Exploration
Search for a node by ID

Set a neighborhood radius

Explore how the selected node connects with its neighbors

Visualize the local subgraph with predicted class coloring
